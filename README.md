### Installation üëÄ

1. Download the newest [release](https://github.com/swiftly-solution/admins/releases).
2. Everything is drag & drop, so I think you can do it!
3. Setup database connection in `addons/swiftly/configs/databases.json` with the key `swiftly_admins` like in the following example:
```json
{
    "swiftly_admins": {
        "hostname": "...",
        "username": "...",
        "password": "...",
        "database": "...",
        "port": 3306
    }
}
```
> [!WARNING]
> Don't forget to replace the `...` with the actual values !!

### Configuring the plugin üßê

* After installing the plugin, you need to change the prefix from `addons/swiftly/configs/plugins` (optional) and if you want, you can change the messages from `addons/swiftly/translations`.

### Adding Admins ‚öôÔ∏è

* To add admins on server, you need to add a new row in admin tables set in `addons/swiftly/configs/plugin/admins.json` respecting the following conditions:

```
steamid => SteamID 64 of the player
flags => The flags provided below (example: abcd)
immunity => A number greater or equal than 0
```

* Or, you can use `sw_admins add` in server console, respecting the following conditions:

```
steamid => SteamID 64 of the player
username => SteamID 64 of the player
flags => The flags provided below (example: abcd)
immunity => A number greater or equal than 0
group => Optional, Group Name
```
